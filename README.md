# MoreVerbatim

Firefox addon for verbatim Google search that's more verbatim than "verbatim" mode.

If you include "v" as a Google search term it will add double quotes to all your terms (and remove the "v"). This is useful to prevent Google from assuming that one of the search terms is superfluous and ignoring it.

Install the addon from the Mozilla site: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/moreverbatim/

Pull requests welcome.

## Example

If you type: `v uiwebview "set scroll position" ios`

You will actually search for: `"uiwebview" "set scroll position" "ios"`
